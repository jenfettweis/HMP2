plotRankByPC

Description

plotRankByPC is a collection of functions for creating intensity plots
to visualize the influence on variation by number of components used

workflow: 
starting with a data frame of object projections on axes (ade4 species or samples object),

	getDistances derives distances from origin from projections
	getDeciles or getTenths derives rank indices of objects from getDistances
		getDeciles ranks by sample density
		getTenths ranks by "range", i.e. distance
	getRankLiers is used internally for sorting
	plotPASD or plotIntensity plots data frame of rank indices from getTenths or getDeciles
		plotPASD plots data frame of rank indices for a specific rank
		plotIntensity plots data frame of rank indices
		
or makePCVisualizationPlot on projections to perform complete workflow in one step
	makePCVisualizationPlot also allows optional vertical lines placed in graph for the number of axes of interest
	and titling
	
	makeCumulativeVariancePlot to create the associated cumulative variance explained plot

	CountstoProps: converts table of p count variables to p proportions of row totals for each of n rows

	TestDiffs: performs paired t tests on corresponding columns of two tables of the same dimensions (n x p) and returns (+1) if column in first table is less than the corresponding column in second table, (-1) if column in first table is more than the corresponding column in second table, or (0) for no difference.  Output is a vector of 1s,0s, and -1s of length p.  Confidence level, CL, is 0.8 by default.

	plotIntensityCountsdiff : Creates a single intensity plot with two rows of intensities for two sets of rank indices using the same species from two different data sets and colored by whether the counts increased (purple) or decreased (green) in the second data set with respect to the first data set
	
	plotIntensityPropsdiff : Creates a single intensity plot with two rows of intensities for two sets of rank indices using the same species from two different data sets and colored by whether the proportions increased (red), decreased (blue), or stayed the same (gray) in the second data set with respect to the first data set

Usage and arguments

getRankLiers <- function(df, rank)
									input: matrix of rank indices and an integer from 1-10 specifying which tenth of distance is of interest
									output: new data frame with number of times in the rank and max axes used in rank; required for sorting

plotPASD <- function(df, rank, covar=NULL, covarColors=NULL)
																input: df=getDeciles or getTenths, rank=rank of interest, covar=NULL or covariate of 
																	interest associated with rows, covarColors=NULL or vector of colors by which to color 
																	rows in plot corresponding to covariate levels
																output: plot for all objects satisfying given distance rank by number of axes

plotIntensity <- function(df, covar=NULL, covarColors=NULL, plotOrder=NULL)
																	input: df=getDeciles or getTenths, covar=NULL or covariate of interest 
																				associated with rows, covarColors=NULL or vector of colors by which to 
																				color rows in plot corresponding to covariate levels, plotOrder=Null or 
																				user specified ordering 
																	output: plot for all objects with color intensity 
																				indicating distance rank by number of axes lighter color: closer to origin; 
																				darker color: further from origin); 
																				returns ordering of objects plotted for use in subsequent plots (plotOrder).

makePCVisualizationPlot <- function(projections, type="presence", byRank="decile", atRank=1, plotTitle=NULL, 
                                    xLabel="Number of PCs used", yLabel="Object", covar=NULL, covarColors=NULL,
                                    plotOrder=NULL, breaks=NULL)
																			input:
																					projections: projection matrix for either taxa or samples 
																					type: use "presence" for PASD plot; use "intensity" for Intensity plot.
																					byRank:	use "decile" to specify matrix rank indices, 1-10, by decile membership use "range"
																								to specify matrix rank indices, 1-10, by tenth of range membership
																					atRank: rank of interest, an integer 1 through 10
																					plotTitle: NULL or user supplied text
																					xLabel: "Number of PCs used" or other user supplied text
																					yLabel:  "Object" or other user supplied text
																					covar: NULL or covariate of interest associated with rows
																					covarColors: NULL or vector of colors by which to color rows in plot corresponding to
																								covariate levels
																					plotOrder: Null or user specified ordering
																					breaks:	vector specifying the axes of interest to be drawn on plot, 
																							any integers of interest from 1 through the maximum number of axes 
																							specified
																			output: either PASD or Intensity plot; if Intensity plot, also returns plotOrder
Note: makePCVisualizationPlot is not recommended if you're using the a subset of the data.

makeCumulativeVariancePlot <- function(eigenValues, numPCs)	input: eigenValues = vector of eigenvalues from ade4 for data, numPCs = the number of principal components
															required to explain the desired amount of variance in the data
															output: plot of cumulative variance explained by consecutive numbers of axes.

CountstoProps<-function(OTU)
											input: n x p table of counts on p variables for n samples
											output: n x p table of proportions of p variables within each of n samples

TestDiffs<-function(Props1, Props2, CL)
											input: Two n x p tables of measurements on p variables for each of n samples and confidence level, CL (= 0.8)
											output: Vector of length p of 1s, 0s, and -1s; ith entry indicates whether the ith column in first table is less than the ith column in second table (1), if ith column in first table is more than the ith column in second table (-1), or no difference in corresponding columns (0). Paired t-test is used for each column.

plotIntensityCountsdiff<- function(df, df2, counts, counts2, title)
												input: df = getDeciles or getTenths for taxa
															 df2 = getDeciles or getTenths for same taxa measured on same individuals in different circumstance
															 counts: OTU counts for first set of observations
															 counts2: OTU counts for observations on same individuals in different circumstance
															 title: user supplied title
												output: intensity plot with two rows intensities for two sets of rank indices using the same species from two different data sets and colored by whether the counts increased (purple) or decreased (green) in the second data set with respect to the first data set.  Difference is measured by subtracting the counts range of the second data set from the first.

plotIntensityPropsdiff<- function(df, df2, counts, counts2, title)
												input: df = getDeciles or getTenths for taxa
															 df2 = getDeciles or getTenths for same taxa measured on same individuals in different circumstance
															 counts: OTU counts for first set of observations
															 counts2: OTU counts for observations on same individuals in different circumstance

												output: intensity plot with two rows intensities for two sets of rank indices using the same species from two different data sets and colored by whether the proportions increased (red), decreased (blue), or stayed the same (gray) in the second data set with respect to the first data set.  Change is determined by t-test as in function TestDiffs (above).
