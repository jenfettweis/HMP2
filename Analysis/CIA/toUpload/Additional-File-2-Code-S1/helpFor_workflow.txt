sortAndMapHandsFree (in workflow.R)

Description

sortAndMapHandsFree is a function that takes multivariate data, some of which has been processed in the ade4 ordination package, and formats it for use in qiime's Emperor visualisation software.   

Usage

sortAndMapHandsFree <- function(inputMatrix, covarColNums = 0, 
                      covarColNames = c(), ade4Out, eigenScaling=NULL,
                      type = c("species", "samples"), 
                      mappingFile, eigenFile, 
                      filteredTaxa=NULL,biplotFile=NULL) 

Arguments

inputMatrix	
the covariate information for either the samples or the species (required)
covarColNums	
a vector specifying which columns of the inputMatrix contain the covariates (required)
covarColNames	
a vector of covariate names in the order corresponding to covarColNums (use the default if the columns are already named)
ade4out	
the dudi object that was created using ade4 (required)
eigenScaling	
specify one of "l1" or "li" if examining samples; or one of "co" or "c1" if examining species.  The default is "l1" for samples and "co" for species.
type	
enter "species" or "samples" (required)
mappingFile	
path to and name of mapping file output (required) 
eigenFile	
path to and name of eigenvector file output (required)

The following two parameters are only used if you are examining samples and want to make a biplot in Emperor

filteredTaxa	
matrix of n named rows of samples and p named columns of taxa, possibly the same table that was processed in the dudi step in ade4. Use to create the biplot in Emperor.  
biplotFile	
path to and name of biplot file output 


Examples
                      
sortAndMapHandsFree(inputMatrix = Sample_Data, covarColNums = 1:7, 
                    covarColNames = names(Sample_Data), 
                    ade4Out = Prop.pca, eigenScaling="l1", type = "samples",
                    mappingFile ="Emperor_Out/mappingFile_Prop_PCA.txt",  
                    eigenFile = "Emperor_Out/eigenFile_Prop_PCA.txt",
                    filteredTaxa = OTU_Prop,
                    biplotFile = "Emperor_Out/biplot.txt") 


sortAndMapHandsFree(inputMatrix = Taxa_Info, covarColNums = 1:4, 
                    covarColNames = names(Taxa_Info), 
                    ade4Out = Prop.pca, eigenScaling="co", type = "species",
                    mappingFile ="Emperor_Out/mappingFile_Spec_Prop_PCA.txt",  
                    eigenFile = "Emperor_Out/eigenFile_Spec_Prop_PCA.txt")
