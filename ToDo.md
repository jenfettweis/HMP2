    - See help/instructions 
    - Try small batch first
- Go through the vignette of https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/HMP16SData.html - Bioconductor version of HMP16SData
- Read in some .biom files using https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomformat.html - package to read .biom files
- Clone and understand https://github.com/waldronlab/HMP16SData - code for the HMP16SData package
